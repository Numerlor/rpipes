[What is the game?]
Boxed is a recursive puzzle game, all within your terminal!

The game starts off fairly simple...

You have a grid of cells and you have two marked cells (marked in red) on your grid.

Each cell consists of anywhere between 1-4 openings and so every time you rotate a cell, you change the positions of the openings.
Simple right?

Now here comes the fun part, 
When you twist cells you can make connections with the adjacent cells,
you can also rotate that cell you just connected to make another connection with it's adjacent cell!
You keep doing this until you figure out a (sometimes crazy!) pattern to the other highlighted cell!

In essence, all you have to do it create a path between 2 points by rotating cells.

With automagically generated levels to the game, enhance your inner path finding algorithm with boxed.py!


[How do I play the game?] 
You can use "r" to rotate a cell
and arrow keys or "WASD" to select the cell you wanna rotate!
